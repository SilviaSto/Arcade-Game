# The Little Debugger Girl

This project is the fourth project of the Front-End Nanodegree Program of Udacity.
The students are provided with visual assets and a game loop engine. The goal is to be recreated a classic Arcade Frogger Game by using Object-Oriented JavaScript.

## How to play

Oh, No! It looks your player is an enchanted princess, who needs to broke the curse. Help her to find the lost elements of her treasure. There are five elements, hidden deep into the river. But be careful! There are evil Bugs, who could turn the princess into a Bug.
Use the keyboard arrows to reach the river.
And don't forget: Avoid enemy collisions! You have only five lives!

Good luck and happy debugging :)
