#The Little Debugger Girl

This project is the fourth project of the Front-End Nanodegree Program of Udacity.
The students are provided with visual assets and a game loop engine. The goal is to be recreated a classic Arcade Game by using Object-Oriented JavaScript.

#How to play

Oh, No! Your player is an enchanted princess, who need to broke the curse. Help her to find five lost elements of her treasure, hidden deep into the river. Be careful! There are evil Bugs, who could turn the princess into a Bug. You have only five lives.
Use the keyboard arrows to reach the river. And don't forget to stay away from enemy collisions!

Good luck and happy debugging :)
